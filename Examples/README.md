#  Examples
This directory contains various examples that demonstrate how to the Kelvin language, from **basic programming capabilities** including _variable/function definition_, _loops_, _if statements_, _error handling_, etc. to powerful **built-in APIs** that carry advanced algebraic operations like _factorization_, _stat calculations_ (normCdf, etc.), _differentiation_, etc.

## Using Kelvin with macOS built-in Grapher

You can copy and paste the output from kelvin directly into the built-in `Grapher` to graph it (I plan to build a grapher for kelvin in the future, but right now, to keep the scale of the project under control, I am using the built-in option for simplicity). The following screenshots demonstrate using kelvin to compute a tangent plane, then using `Grapher` to visualize:
